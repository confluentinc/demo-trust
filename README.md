# Trust Launch Demo

"Trust" is a key marketing pillar for Confluent. Businesses need to feel confident that we will keep their data safe and be reliable partners for their most critical needs. This demo helps to support the launch of the Trust pillar by highlighting several Confluent Cloud capabilities:
- Single Sign-On integration
- Bring Your Own Key
- On-demand cluster shrink/expand
- Stream Governance
- Role Based Access Control
- Audit logs
- Expert support

## Setup

## Teardown

## Future Work
As the RBAC and audit log products mature, this demo will be able to evolve into something really impressive. Here are the key capabilities this demo needs to shine:
- RBAC group access control
- RBAC for schema registry, ksqlDB, and Kafka Connect
- Out of the box support for sending audit logs to Splunk, Elastic, etc.
